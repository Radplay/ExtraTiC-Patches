# ExtraTiC-Patches - Universal
This is the universal version of the script, meaning it contains the code from every other script.
Because of this, it requires all of the dependencies. As such, using this script isn't recommended, unless you need/want all of the dependency mods.
# This script is now discontinued. It won't be updated unless absolutely necessary
